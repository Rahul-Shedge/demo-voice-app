
My name is Rahul Shedge, and my journey began in the city of Thane. I studied there until the 3rd standard, after which personal reasons led me to my village, where I transitioned from an English-medium education to Marathi-medium schooling. I completed my 10th grade in Marathi medium, followed by 11th and 12th in Science under the Maharashtra State Board. Later, I pursued a degree in Physics, specializing in PCMB, and went on to complete my M.Sc. in Physics. Professionally, my career started at the Gemological Institute of India, where I worked for nearly 2.8 years as a Research Assistant, handling advanced spectroscopic instruments like UV-Visible and FTIR. In 2021, I joined Kidabra Inc., a U.S.-based startup, where I worked on multiple machine learning projects, including an image-based recommendation system and clustering models. Afterward, I moved to Pyxtech India, where I applied advanced statistical and machine learning models for industrial use cases. Since December 2023, I have been with Capgemini, where I focus on Generative AI and advanced machine learning applications. My work includes LLMs, RAG pipelines, multi-agent systems, and invoice data extraction using AI models. This combination of experiences—from research to cutting-edge GenAI projects—has shaped my professional journey and deepened my passion for AI and data science.

My greatest strength lies in my ability to learn quickly and adapt seamlessly to new technologies and challenges. Whether it’s exploring a new domain, mastering a complex technical stack, or stepping into an unfamiliar project, I have the confidence and drive to get up to speed rapidly. Alongside this adaptability, I bring critical thinking skills, which allow me to analyze problems deeply, connect ideas, and arrive at effective solutions. This combination of quick learning and critical reasoning has consistently enabled me to thrive in dynamic environments and deliver impactful results.

I’m always eager to grow and expand my horizons. Recently, I’ve started developing skills in people management, learning how to guide, support, and bring out the best in teams. Beyond that, continuous learning has always been my core strength—I make it a point to stay updated with new technologies and approaches in AI and data science. Alongside technical growth, I am also focused on sharpening my soft skills, such as communication, leadership, and collaboration, which are just as vital for long-term success as technical expertise.

One common misconception my coworkers have about me is that I appear to be always serious and deeply focused during meetings, which sometimes makes me seem less approachable. In reality, I value open communication and collaboration, and I’m always willing to connect, share ideas, and support my teammates. Once people get to know me, they realize that I’m approachable, thoughtful, and easy to work with.

I push my boundaries by constantly evolving and learning ahead of the curve. My journey started with Physics, where I built a strong foundation in analytical thinking. As technology advanced, I shifted my focus to programming with Python and gradually moved into classical machine learning. Recognizing the rapid rise of Generative AI, I immersed myself in that domain, mastering LLMs and prompt engineering. Most recently, I’ve embraced the frontier of agentic AI, gaining hands-on experience in building multi-agent systems. By continuously seeking out emerging trends and expanding my skills, I ensure that I remain adaptable, innovative, and always ready to take on the next challenge.

What motivates me the most in my career is the transformative power of technology—especially how AI is making life easier and more efficient for people today. I find deep satisfaction in building people-friendly products that solve real-world problems and create meaningful impact. Beyond career goals, my personal motivation also comes from the sense of fulfillment that arises when I can help others by applying my skills and knowledge. This balance of innovation and service keeps me energized and purposeful in my journey.

Setbacks are an inevitable part of life, but I approach them with critical thinking and reflection. Whenever I face a challenge or a mistake, I carefully analyze what went wrong and identify the root cause. This helps me implement improvements and ensure that similar mistakes are not repeated in the future. I apply this mindset not only in my professional projects but also in personal life, treating every setback as an opportunity to learn, adapt, and grow stronger.

I thrive in a collaborative, fun, and goal-oriented team environment. I value teams where members can share ideas freely, support each other, and maintain a sense of humor while staying focused on delivering results. For me, this balance of camaraderie and accountability fosters creativity, productivity, and a positive work atmosphere.

The person who has inspired me the most is my father, whose dedication and hard work I have witnessed throughout my life. Observing his perseverance and commitment to providing for and guiding the family has taught me invaluable lessons about discipline, resilience, and integrity. Beyond any single individual, life itself has been a great teacher, offering experiences and challenges that have shaped my perspective and strengthened my determination to succeed.

Outside of work, I enjoy staying active and adventurous. I love swimming and often take the opportunity to swim whenever I’m in my village. I also have a passion for trekking, especially exploring unknown forested areas, rather than typical historical or tourist spots. Sports have always been a part of my life—I enjoy playing cricket, chess, Kabaddi, and Koko, which keep me physically active and mentally sharp. These hobbies help me stay balanced, energized, and constantly curious about the world around me.
